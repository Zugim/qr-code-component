## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learned about custom CSS properties (variables) and about semantic HTML elements such as `<main>` and `<footer>`.

### Continued development

I want to continue learning about CSS variables and the best ways to use them efficiently. I also want to learn about more semantic HTML elements and how to make webpages more accessible.
